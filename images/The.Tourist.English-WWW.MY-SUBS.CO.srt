1
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,404
Thank you, captain.

2
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:18,828
Well?

3
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,247
The target is still in the same place.

4
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,006
Target is leaving the apartment.
Ten seconds.

5
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,424
Start the engine.

6
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,037
Underwear or no underwear today?

7
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,916
Be a little more professional, guys.

8
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,510
She's turning left.
She's going to her usual café.

9
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:29,690
May I take your order?

10
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,818
A tea with milk,
an orange juice and--

11
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,236
And a croissant.

12
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,112
It's already ordered.

13
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,405
Thank you.

14
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,372
Do you have a visual?

15
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,083
We have a visual.
She's drinking her tea.

16
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,751
<i>Come again?</i>

17
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,503
She's drinking her tea!

18
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,755
Did you ask for a tea, sir?

19
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,590
No, no. Thank you.

20
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,567
I'm looking for Ms. Elise Ward.

21
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,777
That's Ms. Ward over there.

22
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,950
Elise Ward?

23
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,994
-Yes, it's me.
-I have an envelope for you.

24
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,831
Somebody is taIking to her.
Looks like a courier.

25
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,204
No, no. It's okay. It's a gift.

26
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,504
Goodbye.

27
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,517
-Take him.
-Let's get him.

28
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,981
Sir, stop! Police!

29
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,194
What's going on?

30
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,030
-You are under arrest.
-Financial Crimes Division.

31
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,740
Division what?

32
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,367
Guys, I'm working!

33
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,440
Daniel, get over there now.

34
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,827
Drive around to the other side! Go!

35
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,465
Turn right at the end.

36
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,635
Faster!

37
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,924
How about a photo?

38
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,634
Go right ahead.

39
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,553
Make me look good.

40
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,695
Memorize his face.

41
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,824
The train arrives in ten minutes.

42
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,243
As soon as he steps off, arrest him.

43
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,350
Understood.

44
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,065
The operation has been canceled.

45
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,568
Return to headquarters. Quickly.

46
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,570
On the other side.

47
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,623
Welcome to Venezia, signora.

48
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,944
-He doesn't look like Pearce.
-Boss said he might not.

49
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,404
Grab him!

50
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,171
Boss wants him alive, you idiot!

51
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,266
She's coming back.

52
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:04,706
Prepare to intervene.

53
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,268
Headquarters!

54
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,312
Send me backup to the fruit market.

55
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,773
I have a nutcase who wants to jump.

56
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,232
Probably American.

57
00:44:58,446 --> 00:44:59,946
Stop, stop! Please!

58
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,244
Don't do it!

59
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,803
Bastard!

60
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:50,940
Remember, don't shoot him!

61
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:55,977
They are back.

62
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,522
I come back tomorrow?

63
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:10,675
I don't think she actually knows.

64
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:44,894
No. Knife.

65
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:53,986
This guy is crazy.

66
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,849
This was the man on the boat.
